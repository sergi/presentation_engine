This is the presentation engine for LibreOffice's SVG presentation export. My
intention is to refactor it using some modern JavaScript while preserving
compatibility and reduce it in size.

Currently every presentation is exported into a SVG file that is minimum 400kb
(!!). That is cleary crazy, so I am hoping to improve that.
